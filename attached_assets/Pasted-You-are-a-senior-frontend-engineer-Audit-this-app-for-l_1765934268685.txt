You are a senior frontend engineer. Audit this app for layout and responsiveness issues and fix them end-to-end.

Goal

Make the UI visually consistent and usable across:
	•	iPhone SE (375×667)
	•	iPhone 14/15 (390×844)
	•	iPhone 14/15 Pro Max (430×932)
	•	iPad (768×1024)
	•	Desktop (1440×900)

What to detect (must check every screen)
	1.	Overflow / clipping
	•	Any horizontal scroll (overflow-x) or clipped content
	•	Text, buttons, modals, dropdowns, toasts cut off
	2.	Spacing + alignment
	•	Inconsistent padding/margins between sections
	•	Misaligned icons, headers, CTAs
	3.	Typography
	•	Text wrapping poorly, truncation, line-height issues
	•	Headings too large/small on mobile
	4.	Interactive elements
	•	Tap targets < 44px
	•	Buttons too close together, unusable on mobile
	5.	Sticky/fixed elements
	•	Headers/footers overlapping content
	•	Safe-area issues (iOS notch / home bar)
	6.	Forms
	•	Inputs off-screen when keyboard opens
	•	Labels/placeholders clipped
	7.	Modals/Drawers
	•	Cannot scroll long content
	•	Close button unreachable

Required approach
	•	Run the app and systematically visit every route/screen/state (empty, loading, error, long content).
	•	Add a layout debug mode (toggle via env var or query param like ?debugLayout=1) that outlines container boxes and highlights overflow.
	•	Add automated checks:
	•	If Playwright/Cypress exists, add tests that fail on horizontal overflow and clipped elements.
	•	Otherwise add a lightweight script that renders key pages at the target viewports and asserts document.documentElement.scrollWidth <= window.innerWidth.

Fix standards (do this, not hacks)
	•	Prefer responsive primitives: flex/grid, min/max-width, clamp(), gap, flex-wrap
	•	Replace hard-coded heights with fluid layout where possible
	•	Use box-sizing: border-box globally
	•	Ensure images/media have max-width: 100% and proper object-fit
	•	Respect iOS safe areas: padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom) where needed
	•	No “magic numbers” unless documented with a reason

Deliverables
	1.	A prioritized list of issues found (screen + viewport + screenshot if possible).
	2.	The code changes to fix them.
	3.	A short “how to verify” checklist and how to use debugLayout mode.

Start now: scan the codebase, identify layout patterns/components reused across screens, then fix the shared root causes first (global CSS, layout wrappers, spacing scale, header/footer, modal components).
