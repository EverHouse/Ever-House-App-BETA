Configurations are similar to secrets, but should only be used for non-sensitive information. They're useful for having a variable that's different between your published app and when testing on Replit.

can you clean up the code and remove any files that we don't need anymore. aiming to have the file less than 100MB

what else can we do to optimize the app


2 messages & 2 actions
Let me get some strategic recommendations for further optimizations.
explain what on the app would need to change for each of those

Here's what each optimization would involve:

1. Code Splitting
What changes: Wrap page components with React.lazy() and Suspense

Example: Instead of importing AdminDashboard directly, load it only when an admin navigates there
Files affected: src/App.tsx (router), individual page imports
User experience: Faster initial page load, slight delay when visiting new sections for the first time
2. Image Optimization
What changes: Generate multiple sizes of gallery/hero images

Run a script to create small/medium/large versions of each image
Update <img> tags to use srcset so browsers pick the right size
Files affected: public/images/, gallery components
User experience: Mobile users load smaller images, saves data
3. Database Indexes
What changes: Add index migrations for common queries

Create indexes on: bookings(resource_id, start_time, status), users(email), users(hubspot_id)
Files affected: New migration file in Drizzle
User experience: Faster booking calendar loads, quicker member lookups
4. Lazy Load Heavy Features
What changes: Delay loading admin tools, notification sounds, haptics

Move these into dynamically imported modules
Only load when user is authenticated and on relevant pages
Files affected: src/utils/sounds.ts, src/hooks/useHaptics.ts, admin components
User experience: Faster login experience
5. API Caching
What changes: Add in-memory caching for read-heavy endpoints

Cache announcements, events, menu items for a few minutes
Invalidate cache when data changes
Files affected: server/routes/ API handlers
User experience: Faster page loads, less database load
6. Bundle Analysis
What changes: Run Vite's bundle analyzer to see what's biggest

Identify large dependencies and evaluate alternatives
No code changes initially—just analysis
User experience: Potentially smaller download sizes
7. Remove Dead Code
What changes: Audit and delete unused components/hooks

Scan for exports that aren't imported anywhere
Remove commented-out code blocks
Files affected: Various across src/
User experience: Cleaner codebase, slightly smaller bundle
