Final Polish & QA Checklist Prompt
**I. Global Aesthetic & Polish (Consistency & Premium Feel)**

1.  **Global Font Check:** Perform a final audit on all text elements across all Public, Member, and Admin pages to ensure the *sans-serif (Inter)* font is exclusively and consistently applied.
2.  **Icon Audit:** Ensure all Material Symbols icons across the entire app (nav, buttons, lists) use the *thinnest line weight (wght: 300)* and remain as outlines unless denoting an active/selected state.
3.  **Scrollbar Fix:** Ensure all scrollable containers, especially the horizontal content areas (e.g., membership cards, date pickers) and the main content views, have the *subtle/invisible scrollbar* style applied globally.
4.  **Premium Glass Refinement:** Review the *glass-card*, *glass-button*, and *MenuOverlay* elements to ensure the liquid glass effect is uniformly crystalline (approx. 3-5% opacity), highly blurred, and that all corners use the *sharp squircle* style (e.g., 8px for buttons, 12px for cards).

**II. Readability & Contrast (Accessibility & Legibility)**

1.  **Full Contrast Audit:** Verify text color against background color for maximum readability:
    * **Light Pages (Public):** Ensure all text and icons use the **Deep Green (#293515)** or Black against the Bone background. (Check footer text opacity).
    * **Dark Pages (Member/Admin):** Ensure all text and icons use **White** against the dark glass/background. (Check subtle date/time text).
2.  **Selection Contrast:** Confirm that all active/selected states (bottom nav, time slots, category tabs) use the **Lavender accent (#CCB8E4)** background with **Deep Green text (#293515)** for perfect legibility.
3.  **Button Readability:** Ensure all buttons have enough padding (negative space) and that the text is visually centered.

**III. Layout & UI/UX Audit (Functionality & Flow)**

1.  **Booking Flow Validation (BookGolf):** Re-verify that the **Confirm Booking button remains hidden** until a **Date, Duration, Time Window, and Resource** (Bay/Instructor/Room) have all been selected.
2.  **Cafe Item Pop-up:** Confirm that tapping a menu item opens the *details modal* (with image and "Add to Cart"), but the small *plus button* on the menu item still provides *quick-add functionality* without opening the modal.
3.  **Admin Portal Layout:** Ensure all form forms and tables in the Staff Portal (Admin Dashboard) are completely **mobile-responsive** (stacking correctly on small screens) and maintain the top/bottom nav bar structure.
4.  **Global Spacing:** Conduct a final pass to increase padding/margins (negative space) on all major page sections (Dashboard, Events, Wellness) to provide a cleaner, more editorial feel.
This consolidated prompt covers global design settings, accessibility (contrast), navigation fixes, and feature-specific logic.
