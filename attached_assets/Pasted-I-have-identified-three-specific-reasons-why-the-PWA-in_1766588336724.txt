I have identified three specific reasons why the PWA (installed app) feels "worse" or buggy compared to the mobile browser version, along with the fixes for each.
The Problems
1. The "Notch" Overlap (Layout Glitch)
    * Why: In your index.html, you set <meta name="viewport" ... viewport-fit=cover" />. This tells the iPhone to render your app under the status bar (time/battery) and the notch.
    * Result: In the Browser, Safari adds a top bar, pushing your app down. In the PWA, that bar is gone, so your Header (Menu, Logo, Profile) sits partially underneath the status bar text, making buttons hard to tap and looking broken.
2. Aggressive Caching (Stale App Syndrome)
    * Why: Your sw.js (Service Worker) uses a "Cache First" strategy for the app shell (/, index.html).
    * Result: When you deploy a fix, PWA users won't see it immediately. They see the old cached version from yesterday. The app updates in the background, but they won't see changes until they fully close and reopen the app (sometimes twice). This makes the app feel like "fixes don't work."
3. Rubber-Banding (Non-Native Feel)
    * Why: iOS Safari allows the entire page to be dragged down (revealing a grey background), which breaks the illusion of a native app.
    * Result: The app feels "loose" and web-like.

The Fixes
"I need to fix 3 specific PWA (Progressive Web App) issues that are making the installed app feel broken compared to the browser version.
1. Fix Notch/Status Bar Overlap: In src/App.tsx, update the <header> class. Change py-4 to pt-[max(16px,env(safe-area-inset-top))] pb-4. Also, update the <main> element's top padding from pt-[72px] to pt-[max(72px,calc(env(safe-area-inset-top)+72px))] so content doesn't hide behind the header.
2. Fix Stale Updates: In public/sw.js, change the fetch strategy for the root HTML file (/ or index.html). Currently, it returns the cached version immediately (Stale-While-Revalidate). Change this to Network First (try to fetch the latest version from the server; if that fails/offline, then use the cache). This ensures users always see the latest deployment.
3. Fix Rubber-Banding: In src/index.css, add overscroll-behavior-y: none; to the html and body tags to prevent the entire app from bouncing when scrolling past the edges."

Code Reference (What Replit should apply)
1. src/App.tsx (Layout Fix)
TypeScript



// Inside the headerContent variable:
<header className={`fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 ... pt-[max(16px,env(safe-area-inset-top))] pb-4 ...`}>
  {/* ... */}
</header>

// Inside the main render return:
<main 
    id="main-content"
    className={`flex-1 relative ${showHeader ? 'pt-[max(72px,calc(env(safe-area-inset-top)+72px))]' : ''} ...`}
>
2. public/sw.js (Caching Fix)
JavaScript



// Replace the bottom part of the 'fetch' listener with this logic:

// Strategy for HTML/Navigation: Network First, Fallback to Cache
if (request.mode === 'navigate' || url.pathname === '/' || url.pathname === '/index.html') {
  event.respondWith(
    fetch(request)
      .then(response => {
        const clone = response.clone();
        caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(cache => cache.put(request, clone));
        return response;
      })
      .catch(() => caches.match(request))
  );
  return;
}

// Strategy for Assets (JS/CSS/Images): Cache First (Existing logic is fine here)
if (url.pathname.startsWith('/assets/') || STATIC_ASSETS.includes(url.pathname)) {
    // ... keep existing cache-first logic ...
}
3. src/index.css (Scroll Fix)
CSS



@layer base {
  html, body {
    overscroll-behavior-y: none; /* Prevents whole-page bounce */
  }
}
