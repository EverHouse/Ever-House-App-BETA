Based on a review of the provided code files (`package.json`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`, `server/index.ts`, `Dashboard.tsx`, etc.), here is an analysis of potential bugs and UX/UI recommendations.

### 🐛 Bug Report

#### 1. Critical: Duplicate Daily Reminders on Server Restart

**File:** `server/index.ts`
**Issue:** The daily reminder logic uses an in-memory variable `lastReminderDate` to ensure reminders are only sent once per day.

```typescript
// server/index.ts
let lastReminderDate = '';
// ...
if (currentHour === REMINDER_HOUR && lastReminderDate !== todayStr) {
  lastReminderDate = todayStr; // Stored in RAM
  // sendDailyReminders()...
}

```

**Risk:** If your server restarts (e.g., auto-scaling, deployment, or crash) *after* sending reminders but *during* the `REMINDER_HOUR` (6 PM), `lastReminderDate` will reset to `''`. The check will pass again, and users will receive duplicate reminders.
**Fix:** Store the "last reminder sent date" in your database (e.g., in a `system_settings` or `job_logs` table) rather than in a variable.

#### 2. Moderate: PWA Installation Disabled on Desktop

**File:** `src/main.tsx`
**Issue:** The Service Worker registration is conditionally restricted to touch devices.

```typescript
// src/main.tsx
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator && 'ontouchstart' in window) {
   // ... registers sw.js
}

```

**Risk:** This prevents users on laptops or desktops (Chrome/Edge/Safari) from installing the app as a PWA, even though the layout seems responsive and suitable for desktop use.
**Fix:** Remove `&& 'ontouchstart' in window` unless you explicitly want to block desktop installation.

#### 3. Minor: Dashboard Sorting & Filtering

**File:** `src/pages/Member/Dashboard.tsx`
**Issue:** The sorting and filtering logic relies on string comparison of dates (`item.sortKey.localeCompare`).

```typescript
// Dashboard.tsx
sortKey: `${b.booking_date}T${b.start_time}`

```

**Risk:** While ISO strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`) sort correctly alphabetically, mixing formats (e.g., if `booking_date` comes from the DB as `MM/DD/YYYY` vs `YYYY-MM-DD`) will break the sort order.
**Fix:** Ensure the API *always* returns ISO 8601 dates. It is safer to parse these into `Date` objects or timestamps for comparison (`new Date(a).getTime() - new Date(b).getTime()`) rather than relying on string sorting.

### 🎨 UX/UI Improvements

#### 1. Mobile Haptics & Feedback

You are using `navigator.vibrate(10)` in the "Check In" button, which is great.

* **Recommendation:** Extend this haptic feedback to the **Bottom Navigation** bar (`src/pages/Member/Dashboard.tsx` or wherever `MemberBottomNav` is defined). Adding a light vibration on tab switches makes the app feel much more "native" and responsive on mobile devices.

#### 2. Glassmorphism Performance (Android)

**File:** `tailwind.config.js` / CSS
**Observation:** The app uses heavy glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur-xl`, `bg-white/10`).

* **Recommendation:** Verify performance on low-end Android devices. Heavy use of `backdrop-filter` can cause significant lag on non-flagship phones.
* **Fix:** Consider a "High Performance" toggle or using media queries to reduce blur radius on low-power devices if you notice stuttering during the `DirectionalPageTransition`.

#### 3. "Next Booking" Empty State consistency

**File:** `src/pages/Member/Dashboard.tsx`
**Observation:** You have a nice "No upcoming events" empty state, but the **Next Booking** section defaults to a generic "Upcoming Bookings" card if there is no immediate booking.

* **Recommendation:** Make the "Make a new booking" call-to-action more prominent in the empty state. If the user has *never* visited (0 lifetime visits), change the copy from "Ready to plan your day?" to something more onboarding-focused like "Book your first session."

#### 4. Loading Skeleton Refinement

**File:** `src/App.tsx`
**Observation:** `PageSkeleton` is used for route transitions.

* **Recommendation:** The current skeleton is quite generic. Since you have specific layouts for Dashboard vs. Profile, creating specific skeletons (e.g., `DashboardSkeleton` is imported but make sure it matches the actual layout exactly) prevents layout shift (CLS) when the data loads. Ensuring the skeleton header height matches the actual header height is a common missed detail.

#### 5. Admin Navigation Loop

**File:** `src/App.tsx`
**Observation:** The `MemberPortalRoute` component redirects staff/admins to `/admin` if they aren't "viewing as" a member.

* **UX Risk:** If an admin clicks a link to a member page (e.g., `/dashboard`) without first activating "Impersonation Mode," they get bounced to the Admin Dashboard without explanation.
* **Fix:** Instead of a hard redirect, show an interstitial page: *"You are accessing a member page as Admin. Do you want to view as yourself or impersonate a user?"*
