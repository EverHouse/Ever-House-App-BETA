Even House Rules

Our Community Values

At Even House, we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where members and guests can connect, unwind, and enjoy a shared passion for golf and community. To maintain the integrity of our space, we ask that all members, their guests, and our team uphold the following values:

Respect and Inclusion: Even House is built on the foundation of mutual respect and inclusivity. We celebrate diversity and welcome members from all backgrounds and beliefs. We expect everyone to be considerate and mindful of how their words and actions impact those around them.
A Culture of Connection: Even House is more than just a place to play golf—it’s a community. Positive interactions and meaningful connections are at the heart of our culture. Disrespectful or discriminatory behavior, including racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise offensive language, will not be tolerated. We all share the responsibility of maintaining a space where kindness and camaraderie thrive.
Etiquette: We encourage our members to enjoy all that Even House has to offer, whether it’s an evening at the bar, a round on the simulators, or a relaxed afternoon in the lounge. However, excessive intoxication, inappropriate behavior, or actions that disturb the experience of others will not be permitted. Responsible enjoyment ensures that everyone can make the most of their time here.
Open Communication: We value feedback from our members and believe that a strong community is built on open and honest communication. If you ever have a concern or experience something that doesn’t align with our values, we encourage you to reach out to a team member so we can address it promptly.
By following these shared values, we ensure that Even House remains a welcoming, respectful, and enjoyable space for all. Thank you for being part of our community.

Guest Policies

Bringing Guests: Members are welcome to bring guests to Even House. Each member may host up to three guests at a time. Please be aware that during peak hours or special events, we may need to limit guest access. For larger groups or private events, please contact our Concierge to make arrangements.
Guest Fees: Guest limits and fees do not apply in the Café and restaurant—members may bring guests to dine at any time. Groups larger than three should book in advance by texting our concierge.
For access to the rest of the club, guests may visit up to two times before being asked to apply for membership or purchase a $50 day pass.

Use of the golf simulators by guests requires a $25 fee.

Member Accompaniment: Guests must be accompanied by their member host at all times while on the premises. A guest may not enter or remain in Even House without the member present. We ask that members not leave their guests unattended or separated within the House.
Member Responsibility: Members are responsible for the conduct of their guests. Please ensure your guests follow all Even House rules and policies during their visit. If a guest violates our guidelines, the host member may be held accountable for those infractions.
Check-In and Registration: Upon arrival, all guests should check in at the front desk. Guests may be asked to present a photo ID and sign our guest register or waiver prior to entering the club. This process helps us maintain a safe and secure environment for everyone.
Dress Code

Our dress code is casual. Even House is designed to be a relaxed space for members, so comfortable attire is welcome. We simply ask that you choose clothing that is presentable and appropriate for a shared, premium environment.

Mobile Phone & Laptop Usage

Staying connected is important. Mobile phones and laptops are permitted at Even House, with a few courteous guidelines:

Silent Mode: Please keep your phone on silent or vibrate in common areas, so ringtones and alerts do not disrupt others.
Calls Without Speaker: Feel free to take phone calls as needed, but do not use speakerphone in any shared space. If you need to make or answer a call, use your handset or headphones and speak in a low, considerate volume. For longer or more animated conversations, you might step into a hallway or a designated phone area if one is available, to avoid disturbing those nearby.
Laptops are not permitted after 6pm.
Video & Audio: All audio and video content, internet-based calls and meetings, or any media (music, videos, voice messages) should be played through headphones only. Please ensure that no audio is audible to others.

Golf Safety Guidelines

If you’re enjoying our golf simulators or short game practice areas, please keep the following safety rules in mind:

Use Designated Areas: Always hit from the designated golf mat or bay when swinging. For your safety and others’, do not swing clubs in walkways or any area outside the designated hitting areas. Aim all shots toward the simulator screen or designated targets – never toward other people or outside the play area.
One Person in the Bay at a Time: Only the person actively swinging should be on the golf mat or on the turf surface of a bay. All other players and spectators need to stand back behind the turf or in the seating area at all times. This ensures no one is accidentally hit by a club. Always check that your surroundings are clear before you swing a golf club.
No Horseplay: For everyone’s safety, refrain from any horseplay with the equipment. Never throw golf balls, and do not push or shove anyone near the hitting areas. Please be courteous and keep physical play outside of the golf area.
Stay Within the Safe Zone: Keep a safe distance from the edge of the golf bays, and never step out onto the simulator area or short game area where active play is occurring. Golf balls and clubs can cause serious injury, so always be aware of your surroundings. If you hit a ball, make sure it stays within the boundaries of the putting surfaces or simulators; intentionally hitting balls outside the facility or at unauthorized targets is not allowed.
No Running Starts or Trick Shots: Always hit from a stable stance on the mat. Do not attempt running start swings or other trick shots that could cause you to lose balance.
Children Supervision: Guests under 16 must be supervised by an adult at all times in the golf area. Parents/guardians, please watch young guests closely and ensure they follow all safety rules when playing.

Food, Drinks, and Smoking Guidelines

No external food or drink, aside from water, is allowed to be brought into or consumed in the House.
No smoking or vaping of any kind is allowed inside the House at any time. Even House reserves the right to prohibit or limit smoking in any external area of the premises at any time at its sole and absolute discretion.
Thank you for helping us uphold these guidelines. Even House is all about community, comfort, and a good time for everyone. If you have any questions or need clarification on any policy, our team is always happy to assist.
