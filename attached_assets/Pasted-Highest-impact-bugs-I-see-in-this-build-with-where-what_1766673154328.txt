Highest-impact bugs I see in this build (with where + what to change)
1) iOS “double-tap to click” on bottom nav + hamburger/menu links

Why it’s likely happening

You rely on a mix of onClick + onTouchEnd + preventDefault() in some places (bottom nav), but other tap targets (hamburger, menu links) are onClick only.

Several tap targets have hover: transitions. On iOS Safari, “first tap = hover/focus, second tap = activate” still shows up in real apps.

Some fixed/overlay wrappers use pointer-events-none patterns that are occasionally flaky on iOS when combined with portals + blur.

Where

src/App.tsx (member header buttons + MemberBottomNav)

src/components/MenuOverlay.tsx (MenuLink)

Fix pattern (consistent + iOS-safe)

Standardize to Pointer Events:

Use onPointerUp for actual navigation/toggles.

Keep onClick as a fallback (keyboard/older browsers), but guard against double-fire.

Move hover-only styling behind (hover:hover) so touch devices don’t get “first tap hover”.

Concrete changes

Replace tap handling on nav + hamburger/menu items:

Member bottom nav: remove the onTouchEnd handler entirely and use onPointerUp instead.

Menu overlay links: add onPointerUp (don’t rely on onClick only).

Guard against double firing:

Store a timestamp ref and ignore events within ~350ms.

Gate hover styles on touch:

Create a utility CSS block (in src/index.css) and use a hoverable class for hover transforms instead of raw hover: everywhere:

@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .hoverable:hover { transform: translateX(0.25rem); }
}


Then remove hover:translate-x-1 from menu links and apply hoverable.

2) Cafe menu inconsistency (public shows items but admin/staff can appear empty / missing fields)

You have two different data shapes for cafe items:

API returns: description, image_url

UI expects in places: desc, image

Where

src/pages/Public/Cafe.tsx (uses API response directly, but renders item.desc and item.image)

src/contexts/DataContext.tsx (correctly maps to desc + image)

src/pages/Admin/AdminDashboard.tsx (CafeAdmin uses useData().cafeMenu)

Symptoms

Public cafe page can “work” but descriptions/images are silently missing because it reads desc/image that aren’t in the API payload.

Staff cafe admin depends on the DataContext mapping, so it can diverge from what PublicCafe shows.

Fix

Create one normalizer and use it everywhere.

Add src/utils/normalizeCafeItem.ts:

Input: API row (description, image_url)

Output: UI shape (desc, image)

Then:

In Public/Cafe.tsx, map fetched rows through the normalizer (or just render from useData().cafeMenu and stop doing a duplicate fetch).

In DataContext.tsx, reuse the same normalizer.

Also fix this admin bug

In CafeAdmin save:

if (!newItem.name || !newItem.price) return; blocks price = 0 (you already seed at least one “market price” item at 0).

Change to: newItem.price === undefined || newItem.price === null || Number.isNaN(Number(newItem.price))

3) Scroll-driven UX features are broken on mobile (BackToTop + bottom-nav hide logic)

Your app scrolls inside a div:

src/App.tsx has div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto"

…but your scroll listeners watch window.scrollY, which won’t change.

Where

src/components/BackToTop.tsx

src/components/layout/BottomSentinel.tsx

src/components/motion/SmoothScroll.tsx (also listens to window scroll)

Fix

Create a ScrollContainerContext that exposes the scrollable div ref from App.tsx.

Update these components to listen to scrollContainerRef.current instead of window.

This will also make “hide bottom nav near bottom” actually work on phones.

4) iOS Safari bottom bar background mismatch (green/line showing)

You have duplicate <meta name="theme-color"> tags and an inline script that updates only the first one, which can create inconsistent browser UI coloring.

Where

index.html (two theme-color tags + inline script)

src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx (also updates theme-color dynamically)

src/components/layout/SafeAreaBottomOverlay.tsx (doesn’t paint a background)

Fix

In index.html:

Keep one <meta name="theme-color" content="...">

Remove the inline script that sets theme-color (ThemeContext already handles it)

In SafeAreaBottomOverlay.tsx:

Set backgroundColor to match the current theme (#F2F2EC light, #0f120a dark) so the safe-area region doesn’t reveal underlying page colors.

Quick UX/UI improvements that will noticeably level it up
A) Navigation clarity

Add per-tab page titles (Golf / Wellness / Events / News) consistently (some pages feel like “content blocks” without a strong header state).

Add a subtle active indicator in bottom nav (underline or pill behind icon+label) to reduce “did it register?” taps.

B) Loading + empty states everywhere

Standardize:

Skeleton while loading

Empty state with a one-line explanation + “Retry”

Offline banner when navigator.onLine === false

C) Touch targets + accessibility

Add aria-label to icon-only buttons (hamburger, profile).

Ensure all tappables are ≥44x44 (you started this globally; finish by removing small custom buttons that override padding).

D) Cafe UX (public)

Add category chips + “Popular” section at top

Add “contains dairy/nuts” tags if you have that data (or leave placeholders)
