You are editing a Vite + React app. Important: index.tsx imports ./App from the project root, so the app is using the rootfiles (/App.tsx, /pages/..., /components/...). Do NOT edit /src/* because it is not wired into the running app.
Goal
1. Replace all hardcoded “EH” text logos with my uploaded image logos in public/assets/logos/.
2. Fix Staff Portal (AdminDashboard) where “EH” appears floating in the middle of the screen instead of staying inside the header.
Logos available (already in repo)
Use these paths (served from public/):
* /assets/logos/EH_logo-23.png (dark/black)
* /assets/logos/EH_logo-23_white.png (white)
* /assets/logos/EH-guy icon.png (small icon)
* /assets/logos/EH-guy logo black.png
* /assets/logos/EH-guy logo white.png
Step 1: Replace header “EH” with image logo (root App header)
File: /App.tsx Find this block in the header:
<div className="absolute left-1/2 top-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 ...">
  <span className="font-bold text-xl tracking-tight">EH</span>
</div>
Replace ONLY the inner “EH” span with an image using the white logo (header background is dark green):
<img
  src="/assets/logos/EH_logo-23_white.png"
  alt="Even House"
  className="h-7 w-auto object-contain opacity-95"
/>
Keep the wrapper div and its click handler intact.
Step 2: Fix Staff Portal floating “EH” + replace with logo
File: /pages/Admin/AdminDashboard.tsx
2a) Fix the floating EH bug
Root cause: the header contains an absolute ... left-1/2 top-1/2 logo container, but the <header> is not positioned, so the absolute element is being placed relative to the page and overlays the content (that’s why “EH” appears in the middle of the cafe list).
Fix: add relative to the header className.
Change the <header className="..."> to include relative (do not remove existing classes), e.g.:
<header className="relative flex-shrink-0 flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-4 bg-[#293515] shadow-md transition-all duration-200 text-[#F2F2EC] z-40">
2b) Replace the Admin header “EH” text with the image logo
In the same file, find:
<div className="absolute left-1/2 top-1/2 ...">
  <span className="font-bold text-xl tracking-tight">EH</span>
</div>
Replace the inner span with:
<img
  src="/assets/logos/EH_logo-23_white.png"
  alt="Even House"
  className="h-7 w-auto object-contain opacity-95"
/>
After this, the logo should remain inside the header and no longer overlay the menu rows.
Step 3: Replace “EH” on Public Login with a real logo (icon style)
File: /pages/Public/Login.tsx Find:
<div className="w-16 h-16 bg-primary ...">EH</div>
Replace the “EH” text with the small icon logo (white):
<img
  src="/assets/logos/EH-guy icon.png"
  alt="Even House"
  className="h-9 w-9 object-contain"
/>
Keep the circle container div as-is.
Step 4: Replace “EH” on Public Contact header with logo
File: /pages/Public/Contact.tsx Find:
<span className="font-serif font-bold text-xl tracking-tight text-primary">EH</span>
Replace it with a dark/black logo for the light background:
<img
  src="/assets/logos/EH_logo-23.png"
  alt="Even House"
  className="h-7 w-auto object-contain mx-auto"
/>
Acceptance checks (must pass)
1. /admin Staff Portal: the logo stays in the header and does NOT float over the cafe list (the “EH” overlay in the middle should be gone).
2. Member + Public headers show the logo image instead of “EH” text.
3. Login page shows the icon logo inside the circle instead of “EH”.
Notes
* If you see other “EH” text logos, search for >EH< in the root project and replace similarly.
* Do not change any /src/* files unless you also rewire routing/imports (not requested).
