Here’s how I’d shape this for Even House, based on how you already run membership + tours.

1. Membership pipeline stages
Top-of-funnel (pre-visit):
1. New Lead – Form Submitted
* Created from Day Pass/Tour Request or Membership Application form
* No visit or tour yet
1. Tour / Visit Scheduled
* A date/time is confirmed (could be formal “tour” or “day pass visit”)
Visit & evaluation: 3. Visited – No Application Yet
* Guest checked in via Guest Check-In form
* No membership application submitted
1. Application Submitted
* Membership application form submitted (online or after visit)
Decision & activation:
1. Active Member (Closed Won)
* Mindbody shows paying / active membership, workflow updates deal to Closed Won
1. Former Member / Not Moving Forward (Closed Lost)
* Not approved, or cancelled, or churned
app wouldn’t need to show every nuance; you could group visually:
* “Leads & Tours” 
* “Applicants” 
* “Members”
* “Closed Out”

2. Editable properties (staff-facing)
Goal: protect core CRM logic while letting staff do daily ops.
Must-edit (deal level)
* Deal stage
* Tour / Visit date & time
    * e.g., next_visit_datetime or tour_datetime
* Visit type (tour, day pass, event, etc.) – map to your existing “visit type” logic
* Follow-up notes / internal notes
    * Could be:
        * a free-text deal property like front_desk_notes
Conditional edit (only in certain stages)
* Application status
    * e.g., application_status with options: Submitted / Under Review / Approved / Declined
* Preferred membership tier (if not already set from application)
* Target start date (when they want membership to begin)
Contact info (limited + guardrails)
properties I’d allow staff to edit:
* Email
* Mobile phone
* First/last name corrections
* Primary “communication preference” (email / SMS / both) if you track that
* deal stages
* visit/tour properties
* notes
* application status
* preferred tier
* decision fields

3. Tour bookings: what should the app do?
* Let staff schedule & track tours in the app, and write to HubSpot via:
    * tour_datetime (or next_visit_datetime)
    * visit_type = “Tour” / “Day Pass” / “Meeting” etc.
    * Move deal stage to Tour / Visit Scheduled automatically.
* app is the “front desk console” for context + logging, not the booking engine
* Deeper integration where:
So: Yes, the app should let staff schedule tours and update a tour date property in HubSpot, but I’d keep the first version HubSpot-only and not attempt full scheduler logic yet.

4. Visibility rules
To reduce chaos and training overhead:
* Additional filters:
* deals that need action (e.g., in Tour Scheduled, Application Submitted, Approved Pending)
* “Today’s visits” – deals with tour_datetime = today
* “Overdue follow-ups” – last activity older than X days + not yet closed
Implementation approach:
* Front desk users are “Staff” in your app:
* See all deals in membership pipeline + filters

5. Notifications
I’d bake in a few simple, high-value notifications:
In-app alerts
* Badge / list: “Needs Action”:
* Deal in Application Submitted with no decision after X days
* Deal in Tour Completed / Visited with no follow-up note within 24 hrs
* Deal in Approved – Pending Start where Mindbody hasn’t yet marked them active after Y days

Optional email / push (from app)
(New Lead – Form Submitted)
* Tour scheduled for today/tomorrow
since your app is the “front desk console,” I’d centralize most UX notifications there and only push critical ones via email/SMS.

6. Built-in audit trail
Design this explicitly in the app:
* Every time app updates HubSpot:
    * Log: {timestamp, user_id, HubSpot object (deal/contact), property_name, old_value, new_value}
* Display per-deal history in your app:
    * “Nick changed Tour Date from Jan 5 3:00 pm to Jan 7 2:30 pm”
    * “Sam set Application Status to Approved”
* Optionally store these logs in:
    * Your app’s DB (required)
HubSpot has its own property history, but in app gives us:
* Who did it in the app
* Cleaner, filtered view by property
